ALS is majorly caused by several gene variations. With the availability of Next generation sequencing and patient genome data, it is easy to identify it's association with the clinical phenotype
 
Here, we try to understand the ALS gene variants NGS data corresponding to the clinical significance (associated neurodenerative disease) and influence on the phenotype
